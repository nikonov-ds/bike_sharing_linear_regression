# Linear Regression


Linear Regression Model on Bike-Sharing Data


This case study's goal is to understand what variables affect the demand for shared bikes of a bike-sharing company.


The steps include:
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Preparing the Data for Modeling
* Creating a Linear Regression Model
* Adjusting the Variables for a Better Result
* Presenting the Final Equation for the Model


## *Found Inferences:*
1. The season with the highest amount of rented bikes is Fall, while the lowest number of rentals is in Spring. The ‘season’ variable has a strong effect on the target variable.
2. The ‘yr’ variable is also very important. It shows that more bikes were rented in 2019 than in 2018. With the right marketing strategy, BoomBikes will be able to attract even more clients after the pandemic is over.
3. The month with the highest rental rate is September.
4. The ‘holiday’ variable shows that people tend to rent fewer bikes on holidays, however, the ‘workingday’ variable reveals that people tend to rent more bikes on weekends than on working days.
5. The ‘weathersit’ variable reveals that people rent more bikes when it’s cloudy or the sky is clear, rather than in rainy weather.
